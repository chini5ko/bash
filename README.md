# Easy bash
It is a simple guide that you can scrow down easily and learn quickly.

Just keep in mind that stdout (standard output) is the terminal or the console where the program prints their output

## echo

let's begin with a simple echo which prints a line of text. 

```bash
$ echo "bash tutorial"
```

```
stdout:
-------
bash tutorial 
```

## Variables
variables are tricky in bash because the syntax is not as usual as the other programs. 
-   You must not put space between the variable's name, the equal sign,and the variable name 
```bash
$ name="chini5ko"
(there is no space between the string and the equal sign !)
$ echo $name
```
```
stdout:
-------
$ name="chini5ko"
hector  
```
