# Easy bash
It is a simple guide that you can scrow down easily and learn quickly.

##### 2 points before we start 

###### 1 comments 
```bash 
the hashtag sign is use for comment in bash # for example
```

###### 2 standard output (terminal)
Just keep in mind that stdout (standard output) is the terminal or the console where the program prints their output

## echo

let's begin with a simple echo which prints a line of text. 

```bash
$ echo "bash tutorial"
```

```
stdout:
-------
bash tutorial 
```

## Variables
variables are tricky in bash because the syntax is not as usual as the other programs. 
-  (warning!) You must not put space between the variable's name, the equal sign,and the variable name 
```bash
$ name="chini5ko" # (there is no space between the string and the equal sign !)
$ echo $name
```
```
stdout:
-------
$ name="chini5ko"
hector  
```
