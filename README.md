# Easy bash
It is a simple guide that you can scrow down easily and learn quickly (assuming that you have some programming experience).

#### 2 points before we start 

##### 1) comment key word is #
```bash 
the hashtag is use as comments # <--- as an example 
```

##### 2) output (terminal)
Just keep in mind that output (standard output) is the terminal to show our testing :)  

```
stdout:
-------
example
```

## echo

let's begin with a simple echo which prints a line of text. 

```bash
$ echo "bash tutorial"
```

```
output:
-------
bash tutorial 
```

## Variables
variables are tricky in bash because the syntax is not as usual as the other programs. 
-  ```<warning>``` You must not put space between the variable's name, the equal sign,and the string assigned to the name 
```bash
$ name="chini5ko" # (there is no space between the string and the equal sign !)
$ echo $name
```
```
output:
-------
chini5ko  
```
